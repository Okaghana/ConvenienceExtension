# Processing Convenience Extension

This is a, currently relativly small, tool for the Processing IDE. Up to this point the tool comes with an automatic bracket closer and has a basic Autocompelte algorithm.
The tool is in an early state and there a quite some bugs the have to be fixed, but I am currently working on it, although maybe not on full-duty.

## List of Features:
+ Bracket Closer
+ Basic Autocomplete

## Planned Features:
+ Prompts to add Javadoc
+ Expand Autcomplete to even suggest classes and class-instances and detect the deletion of variables

## Known Bugs
+ Settings menu can only be opened once
+ The position of the popup menu might be off when zoomed in or using a bigger font size
+ The Autocompelte is kinda scetchy and behaves clunky

If you have any suggestion on Features to implement, improvements or you find any bugs, feel free to let me know. 
Any contributions and collaborations are greatly appreciated.
